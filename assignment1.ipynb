    "Compiler: A compiler is a software program that translates the entire source code of a program into machine code or an executable file before its execution. The compilation process involves several stages, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. Once the code is compiled, the resulting machine code or executable file can be executed multiple times without the need for recompilation. Examples of compiled languages are C, C++, Java (bytecode compiled by Java Virtual Machine), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreter: An interpreter is a program that directly executes the source code line by line, without the need for prior compilation. The interpreter reads the source code, interprets each instruction, and executes it immediately. It translates and executes the code one line at a time, making it slower compared to compiled code. Interpreted languages often provide a more interactive and dynamic programming environment. Examples of interpreted languages are Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc."

The JVM uses the JIT compiler to optimize the performance of the program by selectively compiling parts of the bytecode into native machine code.\n",
